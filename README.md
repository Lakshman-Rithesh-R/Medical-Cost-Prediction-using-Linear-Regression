# Medical-Cost-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
A machine learning project predicting medical insurance costs using regression models and visualization.

📌 Project Overview

Healthcare expenses vary significantly depending on personal attributes like age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region.
This project uses Linear Regression to predict medical insurance costs based on these factors, helping to demonstrate how data-driven insights can be applied in the healthcare domain.

🚀 Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Cleaned, visualized, and explored the dataset.

🧹 Data Preprocessing: Encoded categorical variables, scaled features.

📈 Model Building: Applied Linear Regression to predict medical costs.

📉 Performance Evaluation: Used metrics such as R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE).

🎨 Visualization: Classic Regression plots (X vs Y) and residual error plots for clarity.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.10+

Libraries:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

📂 Dataset

The dataset used: Medical Cost Personal Dataset

Attributes: age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, charges.

Target: charges (medical insurance cost).

⚙️ Installation & Setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/Lakshman-Rithesh-R/medical-cost-prediction.git

# Navigate into project
cd medical-cost-prediction

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

▶️ Usage

Run the project script to train the model and view predictions:

python medical_cost_prediction.py

📊 Sample Output

✅ Regression line fitting charges vs BMI
✅ Residual error plot
✅ R² Score and MSE results

(Screenshots/plots can be added here for visuals)

📈 Results

Model Performance:

R² Score: ~0.74

Mean Squared Error: (example output from your code)

(Numbers will vary depending on training/test split)

🔮 Future Work

Try Polynomial Regression for non-linear patterns.

Experiment with Regularization (Ridge/Lasso).

Deploy the model with a Flask/Django web app.
